# LLM-Engineering Projects Repository

Welcome to the LLM-Engineering repository! This space is dedicated to housing various projects, experiments, and educational materials related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications.

## About This Repository

The field of LLM Engineering is dynamic and rapidly evolving. This repository aims to provide practical examples and hands-on projects that cover a range of topics, from basic LLM API interactions and prompt engineering to building more complex agentic AI solutions and fine-tuning models.

Our goal is to create a collection of well-documented projects that can serve as learning resources and starting points for your own LLM endeavors.

## Projects Overview

Individual projects are organized into their own subfolders within this repository. Each project folder contains:
* The source code for the project.
* A dedicated `Readme.md` file with detailed information about that specific project, including setup instructions, how to run it, and any specific dependencies.

### Featured Projects:

* **[Web Page Summarizer](./Web-page-summarizer/Readme.md)**
    * **Description:** A Python application that takes a URL of a web page, scrapes its content, and uses an LLM to generate a concise summary. This project demonstrates web scraping, text processing, prompt engineering, and interaction with LLM APIs.
    * **Technologies:** Python, OpenAI API, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium.


## Getting Started

To explore a specific project:
1.  Navigate to the project's subfolder.
2.  Follow the instructions in the `Readme.md` file within that folder.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an LLM-related project you'd like to share, an improvement to an existing one, or a bug fix, please feel free to:
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5.  Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.

Please ensure that new projects are self-contained in a subfolder and include their own `Readme.md`.
